  title: OpenAI Weather Forecast Test
  description: |-
    This is the succession of a test built on symfony 6 framework that utilizes [Weather stack](https://weatherstack.com/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to provides
    customized replies about the weather of different locations. By accessing
    specific endpoints, users can retrieve either funny or serious responses
    related to the weather conditions in the specified place or region.

    For example, visiting the `/new-york/funny` endpoint would generate a
    lighthearted and humorous reply about the weather in New York, while
    accessing the `/new-york/serious` endpoint would provide a more solemn and
    informative response. The API caters to various locations, allowing users to
    substitute *new-york* with any place or region of their choice to obtain
    weather-related content with the desired tone and style.
